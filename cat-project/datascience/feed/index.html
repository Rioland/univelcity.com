										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>About the Course</h2>
<p>Rapid technological advances in Data Science have been reshaping global businesses and putting performances on overdrive. As yet, companies are able to capture only a fraction of the potential locked in data, and data scientists who are able to reimagine business models by working with Python are in great demand.<br />
Python is one of the most popular programming languages for high-level data processing, due to its simple syntax, easy readability, and easy comprehension. Python’s learning curve is low, and due to its many data structures, classes, nested functions, and iterators, besides the extensive libraries, this language is the first choice of data scientists for analyzing, extracting information and making informed business decisions through big data.</p>
<h2>Course Outline</h2>
<p><strong>Week 1: </strong>Python Programming</p>
<p><strong>Week 2: </strong>Variables and Data Types</p>
<p><strong>Week 3 </strong>Looping Constructs</p>
<p><strong>Week 4: </strong>Data Structure</p>
<p><strong>Week 5: </strong>Functions &amp; Methods</p>
<p><strong>Week 6: </strong>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)</p>
<p><strong>Week 7: </strong>Django</p>
<p><strong>Week 8: </strong>Database</p>
<p><strong>Week 9: </strong>Data Science Libraries</p>
<p><strong>Week 10: </strong>Data Science Libraries &amp; Analytics</p>
<p><strong>Week 11: </strong>Data visualization</p>
<p><strong>Week 12: </strong>Projects presentation &amp; Graduation</p>
