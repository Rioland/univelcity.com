<p>User Experience Design, User Interface, Design Thinking, Strategy, Figma, wireframe, Mockups, prototypes.<br />
The UI, “User Interface” is the graphical layout of an application. UI designers create the look and feel of an application’s user interface including screen layout, transitions, interface animations, and every single micro-interaction. The UX, “User Experience” of the app is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements that the UI designers have created. User interface and user experience design are in great demand and are applicable across products and industry domains. With customer experience being the centerfold of product marketing, companies are focussing on enhancing the interface that their customers have access to. By ideating the branding, design, utilization, and function of the product, UX designers set the tone of the user experience. It is about creating a product that meets the need of the user and minimizes/eliminates inconsistencies and glitches.</p>
